Goal
====
A web application that will manage and manipulate educational content
in the form of articles and Q&A learning tools.

The purpose is to facilitate the gathering and organizing of this information so it can be presented
back to users in the form of quizzes and other educational tools.

Support for registered users, with tracking of history, and ultimately
personal content.

Support for mobile devices through responsive design.

Data Model
==========

The data model supports the following:

Admin and session infrastructure:
- Users (through django auth)
- Sessions (through django sessions)
- User data (favorites, scores, personal content)

Organizational models
- Subjects (the highest level of organization of information)
- Categories (sub-grouping of information, taxonomic under subject)
- Tags (able to be freely added to any content to help with organization and search

Content models
- Articles (text and HTML content to explain or hold knowledge)
- Questions (a question and associated answer, used for quizzes)


The application keeps track of which questions have been accessed in a session.
Questions can be presented individually (better for mobile).
Questions can be presented in tabular form (better for large screens).
Answers can be typed in, and will be scored against stored answers.
Statistics will be made available to show a variety of things:
- how many questions have been asked
- success / correctness measures
- coverage data by category
