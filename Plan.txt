Goal
====
A web application that will manage and manipulate educational content, in the form of questions and answers.

The purpose is to facilitate the gathering and organizing of this information so it can be presented
back to users in the form of quizzes and other educational tools.

Ideally we would eventually be able to support multiple users, each with their own content,
private and shared.

Features
========

The data model supports categories of information, questions, and answers.
The application keeps track of which questions have been accessed in a session.
Questions can be presented individually (better for mobile).
Questions can be presented in tabular form (better for large screens).
Answers can be typed in, and will be scored against stored answers.
Statistics will be made available to show a variety of things:
- how many questions have been asked
- success / correctness measures
- coverage data by category
